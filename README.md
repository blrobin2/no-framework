# no-framework

You don't always need a big stinkin' framework.

### Prior Art
- This whole thing began by following [Patrick Louys' no-framework-tutorial](https://github.com/PatrickLouys/no-framework-tutorial)
- I plan on looking at some stuff from [Michael Meyer's version](https://medium.com/@mmeyer/frameworkless-or-how-i-use-php-bf0b119536ad)
